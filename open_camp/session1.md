## Welcome!  



## Purpose of building OpenCamp  

why rails.  

technical principles we will demonstrate.  

explain the difference between websites // web apps (applications).



## Logistics  

1. Setting up a Rails development env (if you have not installed Rails).
Getting Ruby on Rails setup the first time can be tricky. But we have a great solution that makes it easy, [railsmn-dev-box](https://github.com/railsmn/railsmn-dev-box). Checkout the README.md for install setups.

2. Text editor. 
You'll want to have good text editor as your create build the OpenCamp rails web app. Here's a couple suggestions per Operating System, but there are many options.

  * Windows  
    ++ [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)  
    ++ [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
    
  * Mac  
    ++ [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)  
    ++ [Textmate](http://macromates.com/)

  * Linux  
    ++ [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)  
    ++ [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/)  


3. We will be using the command line // terminal a lot.
Rails utilizes the unix command line // terminal commands. This may be confusing and/or frustrating at first, but we would like to challenge you to embrace the command line operations we walk through. It may be hard at first, but once you get comfortable with the command line operations, you'll feel like a super hero navigating the Rails universe. We promise!
